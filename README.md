# Interview exercise

## Get started
Assuming you have a working Ruby environment, from the repo root do:

1. `bundle install`
2. `rackup -p 4567`
3. Browse to [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567)

Upon success you should see the site working.

4. Run tests with `rspec spec`

## Notes
When first loaded it shows the reversed geocded addreses on the map and table.

Click run at the top and the table, map, and database cache will be cleared and then each coodinate will be reverse gecoded one by one.
